1. Chat with Your Data (Natural Language Queries)

  Allow users to ask questions like:
  - "How many tickets were opened last week?"
  - "What's the most common issue with 2022 Sprinters?"
  - "Which sequences have the lowest first-contact resolution rate?"

  Implementation: LLM converts natural language → SQL/API queries → presents results conversationally

  2. AI-Powered Sequence Suggestion (Semantic Matching)

  When a ticket is created, AI analyzes the description and suggests the best troubleshooting sequence. This would:
  - Replace/augment the regex pattern matching with semantic understanding
  - Consider van make/model/year history
  - Provide confidence scores for multiple suggestions

  3. Automatic Pattern Generation

  Analyze resolved tickets to:
  - Identify common issue descriptions that don't match existing patterns
  - Generate regex patterns automatically for admin review
  - Track pattern effectiveness over time

  4. Smart Ticket Triage

  - Auto-categorize incoming tickets
  - Auto-prioritize based on urgency signals in description
  - Suggest technician assignment based on expertise and workload

  5. Resolution Suggestions

  When a tech views a ticket, show:
  - Similar past tickets and their successful resolutions
  - Draft responses based on common solutions
  - Relevant knowledge base articles

  6. Proactive Insights & Trend Detection

  - "2023 Sprinters showing 40% increase in AC issues this month"
  - Predict potential fleet-wide problems before they escalate
  - Identify chronic problem patterns humans might miss

  7. AI-Assisted Sequence Creation

  - Describe a troubleshooting workflow in natural language
  - AI generates the sequence steps, success/failure triggers
  - Converts plain English patterns to optimized regex
